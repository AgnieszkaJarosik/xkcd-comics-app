### Getting started
This app is available on the Expo platform. 
After you have installed Expo onto your device you can 
run the app via this [link](expo.io/@agaja/xkcd-comics-app) or by building your own copy.

To build you own copy, clone this repository to your local machine and install it by running yarn install.

With Expo installed, you can then run yarn start to launch the app.
